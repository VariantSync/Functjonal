 * A semigroup that does not compose two values to a new value but instead

 * An in-place semigroup is thus not pure functional and should be used with caution.
 * Every in-place semigroup is also a semigroup in the sense that the result of a composition
 * is the first value to which the second value was appended in place.
 *
 * @param <T> The type that forms a semigroup.
